Okay, so I've tried signing in and when I when I click sign in on the app When I click sign in on the app and I sign in with you know the replit login manager whatever it just defaults to worker dashboard no active jobs please contact your manager but ideally what needs to happen is okay so there's a lot okay so it's cool for now all this description up there you know when you first log in it says streamline your fieldwork documentation and show quality compliance role-based access sequential work for real-time approval yeah all that text is fine but for now this can all be moved to all this so essentially when you first start the page and it says streamline your fieldwork documentation with the description at the bottom and then role-based access separate interfaces sequential work for real-time approval how it works manager dashboard web for web mobile interface for worker blah blah blah that can all be under a new page at the at the landing page saying how it works and then then that opens that up but for now when the when you go on to the site the main page it just needs to say manager login and and upload photos right there the only two buttons that should be available bright big and easy manager login and upload photos they should be the only two buttons and then a third button that says you know and the third button says how it works and then all the current landing page stuff is under that subheading of how it works so essentially the button that says manager login it needs to take me to a manager dashboard which I can create the jobs and create the jobs and then also assign it I need to be able to assign the job because obviously I'm not being able to log into a manager dashboard at all and then obviously we'll work on the worker mobile interface afterwards but for now I just need you to fix up the landing page and also get those two buttons done the manager login manager dashboard button and the upload photos button which is essentially the worker one obviously I don't want to use the word worker because it sounds a bit demeaning it just you just for now call it upload photo button which is actually the worker mobile interface but we'll work on the worker mobile interface later but for now like I said let's get let's get the manager dashboard and the landing page sorted out first
