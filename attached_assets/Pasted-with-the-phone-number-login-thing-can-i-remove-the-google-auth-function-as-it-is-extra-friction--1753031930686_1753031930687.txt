with the phone number login thing - can i remove the google auth function as it is extra friction ???

That's a fantastic question, and one I hear a lot from developers looking to streamline their user experience! As Gemini in Firebase, I totally understand wanting to reduce friction for your users.
However, for Firebase Phone Authentication on the web , the Google reCAPTCHA verification step is not something you can entirely remove or bypass. It's an essential and mandatory security measure .
Here's why, and what you can do to minimize the "friction":
Why reCAPTCHA is Non-Negotiable for Web Phone Auth

Abuse Prevention: Phone numbers are a common target for automated abuse. Without reCAPTCHA, bots could easily hit your signInWithPhoneNumber endpoint repeatedly, causing you to incur costs for SMS messages sent to fake numbers or for fraudulent sign-ups. reCAPTCHA acts as the first line of defense to ensure a real human is initiating the request.
SMS Cost Protection: Every SMS sent by Firebase costs money. reCAPTCHA helps protect your project from excessive charges due to malicious or accidental misuse.
Preventing SMS Spam: It helps prevent your app from being used as a platform to send unsolicited SMS messages.
API Security: The "invalid app credential" error you saw is precisely Firebase's way of telling you that the request to send an SMS was not accompanied by a valid reCAPTCHA token, indicating that the app's credential (the reCAPTCHA verifier) is missing or invalid for that specific operation.
Think of it this way: Firebase won't send an SMS to a phone number unless it has a strong assurance that the request is coming from a legitimate user interacting with your legitimate application. The reCAPTCHA token is that assurance.
How to Minimize Friction with invisible reCAPTCHA

While you can't remove reCAPTCHA, you absolutely can make it almost invisible to the user , which significantly reduces friction. This is done by using the 'size': 'invisible' option when you initialize RecaptchaVerifier .
As I mentioned earlier, for most legitimate users, the invisible reCAPTCHA will simply run in the background. They won't see a "robot check" box, nor will they have to solve a puzzle. The only time it might present a challenge (like selecting images) is if reCAPTCHA detects highly suspicious activity from the user's IP address or behavior patterns.
Here's a quick recap of how to implement it to be as smooth as possible:
import { getAuth, signInWithPhoneNumber, RecaptchaVerifier } from "firebase/auth";

const auth = getAuth();

// Initialize reCAPTCHA Verifier to be invisible
window.recaptchaVerifier = new RecaptchaVerifier(auth, 'recaptcha-container', { // 'recaptcha-container' can be an empty div, or even just a placeholder
  'size': 'invisible', // THIS IS THE KEY!
  'callback': (response) => {
    // This callback will fire when reCAPTCHA is successfully solved (usually for visible reCAPTCHA)
    // For invisible, it often just means the promise from .render() or signInWithPhoneNumber resolves.
    console.log("Invisible reCAPTCHA solved (or bypassed if user is good)!");
  },
  'expired-callback': () => {
    console.log("reCAPTCHA token expired. User might need to try again.");
    // You might want to refresh the reCAPTCHA here or prompt the user.
  }
});

// IMPORTANT: Render the reCAPTCHA verifier before calling signInWithPhoneNumber
// This makes sure it's ready in the background.
window.recaptchaVerifier.render().then((widgetId) => {
  console.log("Invisible reCAPTCHA rendered.");
  // You can now proceed to ask for the phone number and call signInWithPhoneNumber
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error("Error rendering invisible reCAPTCHA:", error);
  // Handle cases where reCAPTCHA can't load, e.g., network issues, ad blockers
  alert("There was an issue loading security verification. Please refresh or try again later.");
});

// Then, when the user inputs their phone number:
async function sendVerificationCode(phoneNumber: string) {
  try {
    const appVerifier = window.recaptchaVerifier; // Use the verifier instance
    const confirmationResult = await signInWithPhoneNumber(auth, phoneNumber, appVerifier);
    window.confirmationResult = confirmationResult;
    console.log("SMS sent!");
    // Prompt user for verification code
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error("Error sending code with reCAPTCHA:", error);
    // This is where "auth/invalid-app-credential" would show if reCAPTCHA failed
    alert(`Failed to send code: ${error.message}`);
  }
}
By using the invisible setting, you provide the necessary security verification to Firebase while keeping the user experience as smooth as possible. It's the best of both worlds: robust security from Firebase and a low-friction experience for your users!
